**Title:** [SUGAR CONSUMTION REPORT](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fvivian744%2Fvivian74.github.io%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2FMY%2520DASH%2520BOARD%2520sugar_consumption_dataset.xlsx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel, Pivot table, Pivot cart and slicers

**Project Description:**  This project involved analysing  sugar consumption data, including total population and sugar from beet usage per region. It also breaks down sugar and processed food consumption by continent, and shows the sum of GDP per capita in each region.

Total population by country: Visual representation of population  broken down by each country.

Total sugar consumption by continent: The total units sugar consmed by continent, providing insights into sugar consumption trends over time.

Total sugar from beets by country : it Displays the total sugar from beets, allowing for easy comparison of countries over the years.

Total GDP per capital  by region: Highlights the total GDP generated in each region, showcasing the performance in different regions.

Total processed food by contitent: shows the total processed food by continent

Additionally, the dashboard includes interactive slicers for:

Year: Filter the data to view performance for a specific in  a year.

Country: Focus on specific countries to analyze regional performance.

Region: Drill down into the total quantity of sugar from beets and total GDP.

Continent: shows sugar consumption and total processed food.
 

**Key findings:**
The report reveals that North America leads in sugar consumption and processed food production, while Western Europe produces the most sugar from beets. In terms of GDP per capita, North America also tops the list.
